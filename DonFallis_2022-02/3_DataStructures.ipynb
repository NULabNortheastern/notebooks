        "So far, we've seen a few of Python's inbuilt data types: integers, floats, strings, and Booleans. This lesson will cover two additional data types: [tuples](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#tuple) and [dictionaries](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#dictionary).

When we want to retrieve an item in a tuple, we use an index number or a set of index numbers as a reference. When we want to retrieve an item from a dictionary, we supply a key that returns the value (or set of values) associated with that key. Another important difference is that tuples are **immutable**, which means they can't be changed, but dictionaries are **mutable** and can be changed after they are initialized.\n",
